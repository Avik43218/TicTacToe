# Tic Tac Toe — AI Never Loses

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built in Python featuring a **clean GUI** and an **unbeatable AI opponent** powered by the Minimax algorithm. The game is simple, intuitive, and designed to challenge even the sharpest minds. Whether you're looking to test your logic skills or learn how Minimax works, this project has you covered.

## How It Works

- The player chooses their symbol (X or O).
- Players take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.
- The AI uses Minimax to evaluate all possible future moves and picks the one that maximizes its chance of winning (or forces a draw).
- The game ends when there's a winner or the board is full.
